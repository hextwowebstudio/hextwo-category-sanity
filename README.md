# Hextwo Category Sanity
A simple plugin to prevent posting with no category, Uncategorized category, or more than one category selected.

##What it does.

1. If you forget to check a category box and try to publish your post, it will pop an alert telling you the you must select a category before you publish.
2. If you have previously selected the uncategorized category and try to publish, it will pop an alert telling you that you mus uncheck the Uncategorized category.
3. If you have two or more categories selected and try to publish it will pop an alert and tell you that you may only select one category.

In the future I might add a selection tool to allow specifying a number of categories that are allowable, but for now, I think one is a good starting point.
